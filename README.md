# LCS-GUI
Effectively extracting import LCS features from a given data set can be inhibited by noise within the dataset and by the existent of smaller scale features which do not have a large effect on the flow. This tool is supposed to enable the user to experiment with different filtering parameters in order to more effectively extract import LCS features from a dataset.
